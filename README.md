## 📌 Example Dua (For "No Hard Feelings")

**Arabic:**

**Transliteration:**
Allahumma Tahhir Qalbee min kulli suu, Allahumma Tahhir Qalbee min kulli maa yubaGGiDuk. Allahumma Tahhir Qalbee min kulli Gillin wa HiQdin wa Hasadin wa kibr

**Translation:**
Oh Allah, clean away all forms of evil from my heart. Oh Allah, clean my heart and remove everything that displeases you. Oh Allah, clean my heart of all every form of bitterness, hard feelings, and jealousy.
